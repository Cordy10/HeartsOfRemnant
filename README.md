# Hearts Of Remnant
A Hearts of Iron IV full conversion mod inspired by the Great War from RWBY. This is an unlicensed production, and I do not claim ownership or rights to any of the names, images, or music used in this mod unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Hearts of Remnant is a full conversion mod for Hearts of Iron IV, inspired by the world of RWBY. This project is a labor of love that began in 2019 and has seen intermittent development since then. Due to the nature of the original project’s setup, a new repository was deemed necessary. This repository will serve multiple purposes:
- Development Tracking: Follow the progress of the mod as new features and updates are implemented.
- Version Control: Keep track of different versions and changes over time.
- Roadmap: Outline future plans and goals for the mod.
- Feedback: Collect and manage feedback from the community to improve the mod.
# About the Project
Hearts of Remnant aims to bring the rich and dynamic world of RWBY into the strategic gameplay of Hearts of Iron IV. Players will be able to experience the Great War and other significant events from the RWBY universe, with unique factions, units, and scenarios.
## Background Information
TBA
Based On [The World Of RWBY](https://rwby.fandom.com/wiki/RWBY_Wiki).
